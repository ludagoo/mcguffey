    Choose your lesson from the lesson list. Click on the Lessons button any time to get the list. It will show you which lessons you've already clicked on. They will appear white. Click <span id="reset">RESET</span> to start fresh.
  </p>
  </br>
    <p>When the lesson opens, read the word if you are able and say it out loud. Then click on the word to hear it. When you know all the words, click on the "Read the Story" button.
  </p>
   </br>
  <p>
    The lesson shows each word one time and then shows the words randomly. That means sometimes the same word will show up again. After a set number of times based on the number of words in the lesson, a check mark will appear and you can end that part of the exercise if you are ready. It will then show the words beginning with a capital letter and will talk about each word, often using it in a sentence for clarity. Before attempting the story, it is useful to practice the words a few times throughout the day. Having a routine such as looking at the words at breakfast, lunch, and dinner will help form a good habit for learning the words.
   </p>

    I have made some slight edits to the McGuffey Primer, mostly to modernize it, just a little. Instead of liking to watch the boys at play, the girls like to play too! Several names have changed as well. The name Ann changed to Anna, not to modernize it, but just because it's hard for little ones to say and hear the difference between "and" and Ann.

 It is the mill by our house; logs are cut there.

 How do they cut the logs, Tom, with an ax?

 Not with an ax, Betsy, the work is too hard; they cut them with a saw.

 Yes, I think so. The air is cool, and we can walk in the shade. We should go soon, Betsy, or the pile of wood will be gone.

   "Buzz! buzz!" a bee said to Mary.
   <br />
   <br />
	 "What do you mean?" said Mary. "Please tell me once more."
   <br />
   <br />
	 "Buzz! buzz! buzz!" but Mary could not tell its wants.
   <br />
   <br />
   I think it said, "Please let me get some sweets in this vine."

    Lesson 45
  </h3>
 <p>
   One day Ned and I sat on the high hill by the sea, where the tall lighthouse stands. We could look far out and could see the ships at sea.
   <br />
   <br />
   As we sat there, we saw a man nearby, with some sheep and lambs. The man had a pipe in his mouth. He sat with us, and let the sheep eat the grass.
   <br />
   <br />
   What fun it is to see the lambs play! It made us laugh to see them.
   <br />
   <br />
   The man said that once, when the sheep and lambs were out in the snow, an old wolf took one of the lambs, and ran off with it.
   <br />
   <br />
   I think that men should watch their sheep, so that a wolf cannot catch them.

   One thing each time,

   That is the way.

   All that you do,

   Do with your might,
   <br />
   Things done by halves,

   One day John went to the pond to fish. His dog, Watch, went with him.
   <br />
   <br />
   John sat on a log for a time, but did not catch a fish. As he got up to go, he fell off the log.
   <br />
   <br />
   Watch sprang in to save him. John put his arms round the dog's neck, and was soon safe on the log once more.
   <br />
   <br />
   "Thank you, my brave old dog," said John to Watch.

   Do you see that tall tree? Long ago it sprang up from a small nut.
   <br />
   <br />
   Do you know who made it do so?
   <br />
   <br />
   It was God, my child. God made the world and all things in it. He made the sun to light the day, and the moon to shine at night.
   <br />
   <br />
   God shows that he loves us by all that he has done for us. Should we not then love him?

   When the stars, at set of sun,
      <br />
   Watch you from on high;
      <br />
   When the light of morn has come,
      <br />
   Think the Lord is nigh.
   <br />
   <br />
   All you do, and all you say,
      <br />
   He can see and hear;
      <br />
   When you work and when you play,
      <br />
   Think the Lord is near.
   <br />
   <br />
   All your joys and griefs he knows,
      <br />
   Sees each smile and tear;
      <br />
   When to him you tell your woes,
      <br />
   Know the Lord will hear.
